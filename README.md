# dashboard

Creating a practice business dashboard which displays my previous projects completed in the Odin project
I also added a batman theme to it.

# Notes

-you can change the color of a svg file by adding the svg inline in your html file, then you can
add a class to it and use the "fill" property to change the color of the image.

-using position relative and z score I was able to put one container slightly over another to create a box shadow effect to give the containers a 3d appearance, i also used (https://cssgenerator.org/box-shadow-css-generator.html) to generate teh box shadow effect

- you can put a the width of an image as a percentage and then use aspect ration "1/1" to make the image more responsive to screen sizing.

- I need to implement media queries so that the webpage is more responsive
