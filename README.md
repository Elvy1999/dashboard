Creating a practice dashboard for a buisnuess

# Notes

-you can change the color of a svg file by adding the svg inline in your html file, then you can
add a class to it and use the "fill" property to change the color of the image.
-using position relative and z score I was able to put one container slightly over another to create a box shadow effect to give the containers a 3d appearance, i also used (https://cssgenerator.org/box-shadow-css-generator.html) to generate teh box shadow effect
